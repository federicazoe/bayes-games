# A message from Danica Patrick (3 min)

> Hi team!
> The race on the Eight track is approaching.
> This year we are going to race with the HotRod car, but we haven't finalized our choice of tires.
> Our engineers have narrowed it down to two options: the HotRod tires or the Tiny ones.
> They are not sure which ones would perform the best..
> So I would like you to collect some more data and give me some recommendations, based on what you find while playing but also based on our past experience.
> Last year, we had four players racing on the Eight track with the Classic car, once with the HotRod and once with the Tiny tires.
> Three of them finished faster with the HotRod tires, one of them with the Tiny tires.
> For some players this might have been their first race, and everyone raced with HotRod tires first..
> That's unfortunate from your perspective, right?
> But let's pretend that data is okay.
> By the way, our engineers think it's likely that 6 out of 10 races the HotRod tires would be faster than the Tiny ones..but they think that it could also be as low as 4 out of 10 races, or as high as 9 out of 10 races.

> Hi team!
> The race on the Eight track is approaching.
> This year we are going to race with the HotRod car, but we haven't finalized our choice of tires.
> We narrowed down the choice to the HotRod tires or the Tiny tires.
> Last year, we raced with the HotRod car on a different track, the Straight track, and we were almost always faster with the Tiny tires.
> In fact, only 2 out of 10 times our racers finished the race faster with the HotRod tires.
> But because this year the track is different, our engineers are not sure that racing with the Tiny tires would still be faster, as they might have less friction when turning.
> They believe it's not very likely that the HotRod tires would be faster less than 2 out of 10 times ..
> but that there is some chance it could actually happen up to 6 out of 10 times on the Eight track.
> I would like you to collect some more data and give me some recommendations, based on what you find while playing but also based on our past experience and what our engineers believe.

> Hi team!
> The race on the Eight track is approaching.
> This is the first year we are racing on this track..I am always looking for new challenges!
> All players are racing with the HotRod car this year, but we can choose which tires to use.
> Our engineers believe the best are the HotRod tires or the Tiny tires.
> But they have no strong opinion which of the two would be faster.
> They think it might be just as likely that the HotRod tires are faster 2 out of 10 times..
> or maybe 8 out of 10 times.
> They exclude that one of these two tires would always be faster.
> So I would like you to collect some more data and give me some recommendations, based on what you find while playing but also based on our engineers' opinions.
