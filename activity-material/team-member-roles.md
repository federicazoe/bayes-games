The following team roles were assigned to team members at random (by including cards with the role names in team envelopes' and having students distribute these cards).

Assigning students to roles was meant to increase the feeling for each student to be key and irreplaceable for their team. 

1. **Facilitator**: summarizes the question to the team and ensures that every team member speaks out their opinion

2. **Summarizer**: after everyone has spoken out their opinion, finds the consensus

3. **Annotator**: annotates a brief summary of the consensus reached below each question and at the end submits to Gradescope

4. **Timer**: keeps the team on track with the given timeline 

Teams with 5 members have an additional role:

5. **Speaker**: speaks on behalf of the team in interactions. For groups of four, this role is covered by the Timer.
