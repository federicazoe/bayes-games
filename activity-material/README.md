This folder includes:

- [`discussion-handout.qmd`](https://github.com/federicazoe/bayes-games/blob/main/activity-material/discussion-handout.qmd): template to fill out for each team, that guides through the activity, has questions and code. Each team made their own copy of this file, that they accessed via a link on the course's website.

- [`discussion-handout-team01.qmd`](https://github.com/federicazoe/bayes-games/blob/main/activity-material/discussion-handout-team01.qmd): example of how the discussion handout was filled-out by one of the teams.

- [`team-names.md`](https://github.com/federicazoe/bayes-games/blob/main/activity-material/team-names.md): names of three team types, with a short bio of the person inspiring the name. Names and bios were used to label team-specific, physical envelopes with team names printed on them e.g. team-danica-1, team-danica-2, ..., team-lewis-1, team-lewis-2, ..., team-mario-1, team-mario-2, ...

- [`team-scenarios.md`](https://github.com/federicazoe/bayes-games/blob/main/activity-material/team-scenarios.md): Content of the letters with prior information and instructions. There were three letters, corresponding to the three team types. A copy of this information was printed for each team member  and included in teams' envelopes.

- [`team-member-roles.md`](https://github.com/federicazoe/bayes-games/blob/main/activity-material/team-member-roles.md): Each team member was responsible for an essential component of the activity (e.g. facilitating team discussion, filling out discussion handout). Cards with role names and their descriptions were included in team envelopes' and teams distributed them among their members, at random.

- [`discussion-slides.qmd`](https://github.com/federicazoe/bayes-games/blob/main/activity-material/discussion-slides.qmd): slides used in class to explain and guide the activity.
